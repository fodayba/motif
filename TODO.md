## 📝 Notes

**⚠️ CRITICAL: NO BLOCKCHAIN**
- User explicitly removed blockchain requirement
- Do not implement any blockchain features
- Focus on proven, production-ready technologies

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React 19.1.1 + Vite + TypeScript
- Architecture: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- Design System: Premium Swiss spa aesthetic (implemented)
- Icons: Lucide React
- Mobile: TBD (React Native or Flutter)

**Development Principles:**
- Follow existing DDD patterns (see `/src/domain/inventory`)
- Use Result<T> pattern for error handling
- Value objects with validation
- Aggregate roots with business logic
- Repository interfaces for persistence
- Application services for use cases
